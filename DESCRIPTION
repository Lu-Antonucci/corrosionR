Description: The *Electrochemical Data Analysis for Reproducible Research package* 
    provides a working environment for the analysis of data from corrosion 
    measurements of equipment that provides its own proprietary software, but 
    does not offer the flexibility a researcher would want, nor does it 
    accommodate a reproducible workflow.
